# Ensemble-and-random-forest-learning
basic concept to understand the Ensemble and random forest


**What is Ensemble learning?
Ensemble learning is one of the most powerful machine learning techniques that use the combined output of two or more models/weak learners and solve a particular computational intelligence problem. E.g., a Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble of various decision trees combined.


Type of Ensemble technique
1) Voting

2) Bagging and pasting : Base model are same in bagging technique but dataset are subset(dataset can be with or without replacement) .
Types of Bagging technique
**Pasting** is a type of bagging technique where you do row sampling like bagging but  without replacement. Almost this are same.
**Random Subspaces:** Here we do column sampling.
**random paches:** there we do both row and column sampling

3) Random forest: this is special bagging technique
4) Boosting 
5) Stacking
