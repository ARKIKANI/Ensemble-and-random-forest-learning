# Ensemble-and-random-forest-learning
basic concept to understand the Ensemble and random forest


**What is Ensemble learning?
Ensemble learning is one of the most powerful machine learning techniques that use the combined output of two or more models/weak learners and solve a particular computational intelligence problem. E.g., a Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble of various decision trees combined.


Type of Ensemble technique
1) Voting
2) Bagging and pasting 
3) Random forest
4) Boosting 
5) Stacking
